# Native WORLD handoff boundary (not a playable world map)

The previous interpretation of status 0x4F as return-to-title was wrong.
Original-disc evidence:

- MAIN 06027C72..74 requests 0x4F after E014, as reconstructed.
- COMMON 00212F4A contains mode 6/subindex 0 for that status.
- COMMON dispatch slot 6 at 00212FDC points to MAIN 06027878.
- MAIN 06027880 loads the filename through 06027900 -> 0604382C: WORLD.PRG.
- Slot 5 instead points to 0602785A, which loads CHANGE.PRG. It is not WORLD.

The generated module dispatch now binds mode 6 in the experimental battle build
to a service that loads the selected native WORLD.PRG and returns a real live
child task. It does not change the story's requested status, fall through to
status zero, or reuse the module manager as its own child. This stops the
unsupported-slot -> intro loop. Other builds retain their disabled boundary.

**Display, navigation and travel are not implemented by this commit.** The
boundary intentionally remains at the outgoing black screen while the game
loop remains alive. Its one-time `[WorldMapStartup]` log explicitly says
`display/travel unported ... not a playable map`. This is not a substitute map,
temporary menu or claimed completion of world-map bring-up.

Enabling upstream `worldmap.cpp` wholesale is unsafe: Display Init/Update/Draw,
Env Update and Dragon Init/Draw are stubs; camera logic reads their absent state.
Root Init also calls the title save/load initializer, which resets the same map
allocator, and `loadWorldOverlay` returns its parent as the active overlay.
Those need native ports before enabling the map's task graph. The next work is
to recover WORLD 06054504/06054F9E/060551AC display state/rendering and its camera,
environment, dragon and resident-save child services; then expose mode 6 through
the shared scene bridge and verify navigation/travel on hardware.

Direct-disc tests verify the mode/entry/filename chain; the production boundary
fixture checks child ownership, data lifetime, missing-file handling and unchanged
status. Both Vita configurations compile. Neither check proves on-device map
rendering or even acceptance of this runtime handoff.
